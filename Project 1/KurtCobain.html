    <h2>Biography</h2><br>
    <p><strong>Donald Cobain was an American musician who was the co-founder, lead vocalist, guitarist and primary songwriter of the rock band Nirvana.<br> 
        Through his angst-fueled songwriting and anti-establishment persona, Cobain's compositions widened the thematic conventions of mainstream rock.<br>
         He was heralded as a spokesman of Generation X and is highly recognized as one of the most influential alternative rock musicians.<br><br>
         Cobain's family had a musical background. His maternal uncle, Chuck Fradenburg, played in a band called the Beachcombers;<br>
          his aunt, Mari Earle, played guitar and performed in bands throughout Grays Harbor County; and his great-uncle, Delbert,<br>
           had a career as an Irish tenor, making an appearance in the 1930 film King of Jazz.</strong></p><br>
           <h2>Nirvana</h2><br>
           <p><strong>During high school, Cobain rarely found anyone with whom he could play music. While hanging out at the Melvins' practice space, he met <br>
            Krist Novoselic, a fellow devotee of punk rock. Novoselic's mother owned a hair salon, and the pair occasionally practiced in the upstairs<br>
             room of the salon. A few years later, Cobain tried to convince Novoselic to form a band with him by lending him a copy of a home demo <br>
             recorded by Fecal Matter.[9] After months of asking, Novoselic agreed to join Cobain, forming the beginnings of Nirvana. Religion appeared<br>
              to remain a significant muse to Cobain during this time as he often used Christian imagery in his work and developed an interest in Jainism and Buddhist philosophy.</strong></p><br>
              <h2>Problems</h2><br>
              <p><strong>Throughout most of his life, Cobain had chronic bronchitis and intense physical pain due to an undiagnosed chronic stomach condition.<br>
                 According to The Telegraph, Cobain had depression. His cousin brought attention to the family history of suicide, mental illness and<br>
                  alcoholism, noting that two of her uncles had died by suicide with guns. He used drugs heavily; his first drug experience was with<br>
                   cannabis in 1980, at age 13. He regularly used the drug during adulthood. Cobain also had a period of consuming "notable" amounts of LSD,<br>
                    as observed by Marander, and was prone to alcoholism and solvent abuse. Novoselic said he was "really into getting fucked up: <br>
                    drugs, acid, any kind of drug".</strong></p><br>
                    <h2>Death</h2><br>
                    <p><strong>On April 8, Cobain's body was discovered at his Lake Washington Boulevard home by an electrician,[89] who had arrived to install<br>
                         a security system. A suicide note was found, addressed to Cobain's childhood imaginary friend Boddah, that stated that Cobain <br>
                         had not "felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music, along with really writing ... for too many years now".<br>
                          Cobain's body had been there for days; the coroner's report estimated he died on April 5, 1994, at the age of 27.</strong></p><br>
